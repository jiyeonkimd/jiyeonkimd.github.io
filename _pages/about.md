Hello! I am a first-year Ph.D student at [KAIST Graduate Schoold of AI](https://gsai.kaist.ac.kr/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Minjoon Seo](https://seominjoon.github.io) in [Language & Knowledge Lab](https://LKLab.kaist.ac.kr/). Previously, I obtained a Bachelor of Business Administration and Bachelor of Economics at Korea University. I worked as a junior economist at Bank of Korea for 7 years.

My research delves into the origins of language model capabilities, investigating why and how they acquire, retain, and lose their knowledge acquisition abilities during pretraining. I explore ways to optimally harness their potential, including methods for reviving pre-trained models with minimal intervention. More broadly, I examine the fundamental question of what structures and approaches best enable language modeling and reasoning. Through these inquiries, I seek to uncover principles that guide the development of more effective and robust language models.
