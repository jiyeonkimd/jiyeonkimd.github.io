Hello! I am a first-year Ph.D student at [KAIST Graduate Schoold of AI](https://gsai.kaist.ac.kr/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Minjoon Seo](https://seominjoon.github.io) in [Language & Knowledge Lab](https://LKLab.kaist.ac.kr/). I am interested in life-long learning of AI models while interacting with dynamic environments. I have focused on understanding how Large Language Models acquire knowledge and why they lose learning capabilities as training progresses. By studying the learning dynamics of AI models, I aim to develop novel training methods that preserve capabilities, enhance complex reasoning, and integrate diverse inputs across multiple modalities. Previously, I obtained a Bachelor of Business Administration and Bachelor of Economics at Korea University. I worked as a junior economist at Bank of Korea for 7 years.
