Hello! I am a first-year Ph.D student at [KAIST Graduate Schoold of AI](https://gsai.kaist.ac.kr/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Minjoon Seo](https://seominjoon.github.io) in [Language & Knowledge Lab](https://LKLab.kaist.ac.kr/). My research investigates how Large Language Models acquire, retain, and lose their ability to learn and reason. I explore optimal ways to utilize their capabilities, including methods for minimally intervening to restore knowledge acquisition in pre-trained models and alternative structures for language modeling. Previously, I obtained a Bachelor of Business Administration and Bachelor of Economics at Korea University. I worked as a junior economist at Bank of Korea for 7 years.
