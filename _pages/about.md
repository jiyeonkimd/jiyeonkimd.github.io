Hello! I am a first-year Ph.D student at [KAIST Graduate Schoold of AI](https://gsai.kaist.ac.kr/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Minjoon Seo](https://seominjoon.github.io) in [Language & Knowledge Lab](https://LKLab.kaist.ac.kr/). 

My research interests include lifelong learning, neural memory, multimodal diffusion models, and interpretability.
My long-term research goal is to develop multimodal models capable of continual improvement through interaction with dynamic environments. 
Currently, I investigate the role of neural long-term memory in enhancing test-time adaptation. 
Additionally, I am also exploring vision-language diffusion models to integrate both modalities within a shared latent, concept-level space.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration and Economics from [Korea University](https://www.korea.edu/sites/en/index.do) and a Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence from [KAIST Graduate Schoold of AI](https://gsai.kaist.ac.kr/). I previously worked as a junior economist at Bank of Korea for seven years.
